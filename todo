clean up naming of variables and uniforms in shaders

think about getting rid of 3d functionality
  what is the point of maru?
    quickly get up and running?
    useful thing for finished projects?
    started as video library so: special effects
    love2d
      useful for finished projects also quick to start
      out of the way
    maru
      expose opengl
      integrate w open gl easily
      thin wrappers
  good
    clean things up
      simplify shaders
      lessmemory usage and probably faster (probably a non-issue)
    use mat3s instead of mat4s and converting to mat4s everywhere
    3d is specific and pretty difficult
      supporting 3d and doing it well would be a real undertaking
  bad
    restricting
      hard to work around for things that you do want to be in 3d
      meshes are tied to default shader
        meshes should be made more modular anyway
